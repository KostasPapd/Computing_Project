To store the assignment databases effectively for a homework program, consider the following approach using PostgreSQL, which aligns with the database interactions already present in your project:

### Database Schema Design

1. **Assignments Table**: Store general information about each assignment.
   - `assignment_id`: Primary Key, SERIAL
   - `title`: VARCHAR, the title of the assignment
   - `class_id`: INTEGER, foreign key linking to the Classes table
   - `due_date`: DATE, the due date for the assignment
   - `teacher_id`: INTEGER, foreign key linking to the Teachers table

2. **Questions Table**: Store questions for each assignment.
   - `question_id`: Primary Key, SERIAL
   - `assignment_id`: INTEGER, foreign key linking to the Assignments table
   - `question_text`: TEXT, the text of the question
   - `marks`: INTEGER, the marks allocated for the question
   - `question_type`: VARCHAR, the type of question (e.g., multiple choice, short answer)

3. **Classes Table**: Store information about each class.
   - `class_id`: Primary Key, SERIAL
   - `class_name`: VARCHAR, the name of the class
   - `teacher_id`: INTEGER, foreign key linking to the Teachers table

4. **Teachers Table**: Store information about teachers.
   - `teacher_id`: Primary Key, SERIAL
   - `name`: VARCHAR, the name of the teacher
   - `email`: VARCHAR, unique, the email of the teacher

5. **Students Table**: Store information about students.
   - `student_id`: Primary Key, SERIAL
   - `name`: VARCHAR, the name of the student
   - `class_id`: INTEGER, foreign key linking to the Classes table

6. **Submissions Table**: Store students' submissions for assignments.
   - `submission_id`: Primary Key, SERIAL
   - `assignment_id`: INTEGER, foreign key linking to the Assignments table
   - `student_id`: INTEGER, foreign key linking to the Students table
   - `submission_date`: TIMESTAMP, the date and time of submission
   - `grade`: INTEGER, the grade awarded for the submission

### SQL Code for Table Creation

```sql
CREATE TABLE Teachers (
    teacher_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE Classes (
    class_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    class_name VARCHAR(255),
    teacher_id INTEGER REFERENCES Teachers(teacher_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    class_id INTEGER REFERENCES Classes(class_id)
);

CREATE TABLE Assignments (
    assignment_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
